My current plan for checking the validity of packets recieved by the Controller
We will blacklist a certain range of packets (~5?).
The blacklist will extend backwards from the most recent packet recieved

 - Consider what happens when packets arrive out of order.  What happens if the
   packet X+4 arrives before X, X+1, X+2, X+3?   Do we have to worry about this?  
 - Suggestion - How could you use a traditional hash table to maintain a
   perfect answer?  
 - Suggestion - look into a Bloom Filter.  Conisder the advantages of using
   this over a more traditional data structure.  How would you handle the time
   bloom filter as the time horizon broadens?
